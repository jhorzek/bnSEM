# bnSEM

Structural Equation Models (SEM) and Bayesian Networks are closely related. 
The objective of bnSEM (**B**ayesian **N**etwork **SEM**) is to easily transition 
from SEM to Bayesian Networks. To this end, **bnSEM** translates SEM fitted with
`OpenMx` to Bayesian Networks in `bnlearn`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bnSEM from [GitHub](https://github.com/jhorzek/bnSEM/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jhorzek/netSEM")
```

## Example

We first estimate the SEM with **OpenMx**.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mxsem)
model <- '
  # latent variable definitions
     ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
     dem60 =~ y1 + a*y2 + b*y3 + c*y4
     dem65 =~ y5 + a*y6 + b*y7 + c*y8

  # regressions
    dem60 ~ ind60
    dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60

  # residual correlations
    y1 ~~ y5
    y2 ~~ y4 + y6
    y3 ~~ y7
    y4 ~~ y8
    y6 ~~ y8
'

mx_model <- mxsem(model,
                  data = OpenMx::Bollen) |>
  OpenMx::mxTryHard()
```

Next, we translate the model to a Bayesian Network:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(bnSEM)
network <- bnSEM::bnSEM(mx_model = mx_model)
```

To get an impression of the network, you can create a plot:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(qgraph)
qgraph::qgraph(network$dag)
```

## Inference

With our Bayesian Network, we can now investigate the conditional distribution of
variables in our model (see `vignette("Example", package = "bnSEM")` for a comparison
to rejection sampling)

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
# Check conditional distribution
# probability that dem65 in (1,2) given dem60 > 1:
bnlearn::cpquery(fitted = network$bayes_net,
                 event = (dem65 > 1 & dem65 < 2),
                 evidence = (dem60 > 1))

# Get distribution under this assumption:
dist <- bnlearn::cpdist(fitted = network$bayes_net,
                        node = "dem65",
                        evidence = (dem60 > 1))
hist(dist$dem65)

# Now check dem60 < -1
dist <- bnlearn::cpdist(fitted = network$bayes_net,
                        node = "dem65",
                        evidence = (dem60 < -1))
hist(dist$dem65)
```

To check our Bayesian Network, we can also simulate data from the network 
and refit our SEM to check if the estimates align:
```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
sim <- bnlearn::rbn(x = network$bayes_net, n = 100000)

fit_sim <- mxsem(model,
                 data = sim[,mx_model$manifestVars]) |>
  OpenMx::mxTryHard()
round(coef(fit_sim) - coef(mx_model), 3)
```

## Central Challenge 

When transitioning from SEM to Bayesian Network, a central challenge is the 
use of covariances as parameters in SEM. To translate those covariances to a model
that can be easily used with Bayesian Networks, bnSEM replaces covariances with
direct effects of unobserved phantom variables. The approach is explained in
more detail, for instance, by Merkle & Rosseel (2015; see p. 8).
